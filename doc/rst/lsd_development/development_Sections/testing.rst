Testing
-------

Each Model has his own tests folder, within it there are files for testing models, views or urls. 
Each of those files are test classes, which are inherited of django.test classes.
If any file is needed to test a function, for example a License, they should be stored in the Media Folder, path: Media/tests.

For more information on testing visit the django documentation page:
